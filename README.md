3D modeling is a modern tool that allows people to express, communicate
and visualize better. In a study done by Junfeng Yang, Hui Pan, Weiying
Zhou Ronghuai Huang, they state that Technology equipment plus advanced
technology could lead to the success of learning[1]. Visual aids can help students
progress in their studies. From the cinema industry to the educational
system, its scope is tremendous. Smart classes can help students dive into
subjects better by introducing 3D images.
3D simulations are also used in research studies mimicking natural features
and motion. Gaming environments made using 3D graphics have enhanced
the gaming experience. The scope of 3D graphics is limitless in our
modern times.
There is complex 3D software available of industry standards, which are
beyond a laymanâ€™s understanding. In this project, we implemented a software
that would take 2D inputs from the user and develop it into a 3D image. The
user inputs 2D shapes that would be converted into 3D structure implicitly
by the software creating an abstract 3D model. This abstract model is further
developed by adding minute details to it by user input patterns. Anyone with
minimum 3D knowledge can develop this export quality object. We expect
this software to be novel in its implementation and produce an impact on
the educational sector as well as other domains by making 3D modeling less
complex.
